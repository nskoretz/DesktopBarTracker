# DesktopBarTracker



### Description
This is the Java code for a desktop bar application that will let users save and rate recipes,manage an ingredient list and
a list of available cocktails. This program will be built in Java, using the Swing library for GUI. 

This is a personal project of mine as I quite enjoy mixing drinks for people and trying different recipes. Although it is a
personal project, I'll be using conventions and style that I have learned in class, as well as some implementations.
